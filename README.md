# Using APIs to build a perfect trip
## Overview of the project
In this project I used APIs to first based on a certain number of random coordinates find nearby cities, then with the OpenWeather API obtain the weather conditions of each city and using the Google Maps APIs create maps based upon temperature and desired cities. As well as creating an itinerary with the Directions API based upon four different destinations.
## Results
The results were good as you may see inside the Weather_Database folder there are all the cities gather from over 2000 random coordinates. Then based upon those cities I found nearby hotels and created the following map using _gmaps_.

There are a ton of hotels, but only four locations were chosen to build the following itinerary:

And finally the details for each location can be found in the marker map.

## Conclusion
It was a great activity to acquire knowledge on APIs and specially on the great tool that is Google Cloud. I am looking forward to keep using this tools to improve and polish this skills.
